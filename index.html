        <h1>Merveille Naomi</h1>
        <p><em>Aspiring Software Developer, Virtual Assistant, Writer, Editor/Proofreader, Transcriber</em></p>
        <p>To know me is to know I love learning. I aspire to one day call myself a polymath unashamedly. Being a relentless curious cat drove me into wanting to know what Software Development was all about. I'm still on that seemingly never-ending
          journey. There have been good and bad days, but I've loved them all nevertheless. I also love to read, draw, take pictures of the most random things, write stuff I'll probably never show anyone, daydream, and obsess over badass
          Pinterest boards. When I step out of fantasyland and into the real world as a person with a job—or jobs—as is my case, I am a Virtual Assistant, transcriber and editor/proofreader. Why all that? Well, majorly because I love words and the
          English
          Language, but also because as a Nigerian, <em>you gats find ways to always hustle!</em> I dream of working from home as a Software Developer and a writer with the coolest work station, free to wear pyjamas all day and be a catmom to two
          stubborn
          puffballs called Ruffle and Cuddle because those are my two favorite things to do to people and animals.</p>
