        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I love learning—especially through reading—it's what drove me to picking up a book on Software Development. I also love to write, draw, take pictures of the most random stuff, daydream, and binge scroll through Pinterest. What made me more determined to be a techgirl was the realisation that technology is ever-changing—so there's always going to be something new to learn and apply to real life problems, and also because I wouldn't even have to leave my house to do all this. As a homebody creator, that was the perfect combo.</p>
